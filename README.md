First, this requires node js to be installed

So, inorder to run a javascript app on node you need to go to a terminal an type thsi command:
  node app.js
  
If you do that then the result will be "The sum of all numbers is: 0"

If you do something like this:
  node app.js 1 2 4
  
You will get this message "The sum of all numbers is: 7"

This app can take as much arguments as possible and will add them as long as the numbers are the following:
  - negative/positive integers
  - negative/positive floating integers (decimals)
  
This was a starter app for me to get my feet wet while I get more famaliar with Node.js's process.argv property and with Node.js as a whole.
